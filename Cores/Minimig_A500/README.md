This is a port of minimig to the Altera DE1 board.

minimig (short for Mini Amiga) is an open source re-implementation of an 
Amiga 500 using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Original minimig 
author is Dennis van Weeren.

Amiga was (in my opinion) an amazing personal computer, announced around 
1984, which - at the time - far surpassed any other personal computer on 
the market, with advanced graphic & sound capabilities.
